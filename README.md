Heavily inspired by [gygrazok/witchmod](https://github.com/gygrazok/witchmod).

## How to install

(taken almost-verbatim from similar guides at https://github.com/gygrazok/witchmod https://github.com/gskleres/FruityMod-StS)

### Requirements

* Java 8 (JRE). Currently only Java 8 should be used, issues with Java 9 are being looked into.
* BaseMod v5.5.0+ (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
* ModTheSpire v3.6.3+ (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)

### Installation

1. If you have ModTheSpire already installed you can skip to step 5. Otherwise continue with step 2:
1. Download ModTheSpire.jar from the latest release (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)
1. Move ModTheSpire.jar into your Slay The Spire directory. This directory is likely to be found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire`. Place ModTheSpire.jar in that directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\ModTheSpire.jar`
1. Create a mods folder in your Slay The Spire directory so it looks like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods
1. Download BaseMod.jar from the latest release (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
1. Move BaseMod.jar into the mods folder you created in step 4
1. Download JorbsMod.jar from the latest release (https://github.com/dbjorge/sts-jorbs-mod/releases)
1. Move JorbsMod.jar into the mods folder you created in step 4
1. Your modded version of Slay The Spire can now be launched by double-clicking on ModTheSpire.jar
1. This will open a mod select menu where you need to make sure that both BaseMod and JorbsMod are checked before clicking play
