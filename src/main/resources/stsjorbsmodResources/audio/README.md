# How to contribute audio files

Audio effects in Slay the Spire are authored in `.ogg` format.

We don't currently have any custom audio in the mod, but we would love contributions of them!

To see examples of the sorts of audio format/length/etc that the base game uses:

* Open file explorer and navigate to your Slay the Spire game folder (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire`)
* Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (or any other ZIP extractor) to open the `desktop-1.0.jar` file in that folder
* Look under the `audio` folder to see the base game sound files

For questions or discussion of what kinds of audio effects would be possible to add, ask on the [Jorbs Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/jorbs) in *#jorbs-spire-mod-char*.
