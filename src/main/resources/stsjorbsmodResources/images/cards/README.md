# How to make card images

In order to make art for each card, read this guide. The list of card images needed can be found in the [Mod Character Package spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GY0eJsooEp361hWFL2lD-uPVa5-l-7g4f4FtyKs-k7Q/edit#gid=0) and in the readme for each card catagory.

Every card needs two images. I am going to use as an example the card "Fresh Adventure". 
1. A 250px x 190px .png image that serves as the normal card background named "fresh_adventure.png"
2. A 500px x 380px .png image that is used when the card is highlighted/zoomed in, named "fresh_adventure_p.png". The _p stands for portriat. 

These images need to have a specific shape depending on if they are a skill, power or attack. Luckily, there is a tool that cuts the images for you from a 380 x 500 px template and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GY0eJsooEp361hWFL2lD-uPVa5-l-7g4f4FtyKs-k7Q/edit?usp=sharing)

Please feel free to create shitty paint/powerpoint/whatever images for the cards and request a pull for them, so long as they are in the correct format. 

Alternatively, if you want to make art but don't want to process it or merge it in, send it to me (neablis on discord or neablis@gmail.com) and I will format it and merge it in eventually.
