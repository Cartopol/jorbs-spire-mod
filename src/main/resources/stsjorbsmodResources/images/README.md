# Wanderer art instructions

In order to make art for the new class, read this guide. The list of art we need can be found in the [Mod Character Package spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GY0eJsooEp361hWFL2lD-uPVa5-l-7g4f4FtyKs-k7Q/edit#gid=0) and in the readme for each card catagory.

# How to make card images

Every card needs two images. I am going to use as an example the card "Fresh Adventure". 
1. A 250px x 190px .png image that serves as the normal card background named "fresh_adventure.png"
2. A 500px x 380px .png image that is used when the card is highlighted/zoomed in, named "fresh_adventure_p.png". The _p stands for portriat. 

These images need to have a specific shape depending on if they are a skill, power or attack. Luckily, there is a tool that cuts the images for you from a 380 x 500 px template and can be found [here](https://github.com/JohnnyBazooka89/StSModdingToolCardImagesCreator)

Please feel free to create images for the cards and request a pull for them, so long as they are in the correct format. Alternatively, if you want to make art but don't want to process it or merge it in, send it to me (neablis on discord or neablis@gmail.com) and I will format it and merge it in for you. 

# How to make power icons

Powers also need 2 sizes - 
1. 32px x 32px This is the static image on the buff bar
2. 84px x 84px I believe this is used when a power 'activates'. 

The background should be transparent and the power itself roughly circular. See examples [here](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/powers/placeholder_power32.png) and [here](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/powers/placeholder_power84.png). 

# Other Misc. stuff: 

We need a replacement character select Character Select button:	[200x200 pixel image with a transparent background](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/charSelect/DefaultCharacterButton.png)

We need an 'over the shoulder' image used for campfires [EXAMPLE](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/char/wanderer/shoulder2.png) and other events [EXAMPLE](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/char/wanderer/shoulder.png). Not necessarily black and white - that's just to indicate it's beta art. 

We need victory screen art, 3 images that come on in succession. Each are 1920x1200 px and should have the transparency to overlap each other.

We need card texture art: Card texture art	Need 2 images for each, 1024x1024 and 512x512 for skill, attack and power cards. The 512 size is in-game, the 1024 is inspect. [Example Skill](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/1024/bg_skill_default_gray.png), [Example Power](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/1024/bg_power_default_gray.png), [Example attack](https://github.com/neablis-7/jorbs-spire-mod/blob/master/src/main/resources/stsjorbsmodResources/images/1024/bg_attack_default_gray.png)

Check the main mod sheet to see if these are already done.
